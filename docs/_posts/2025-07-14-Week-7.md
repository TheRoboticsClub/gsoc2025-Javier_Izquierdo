This week was focused on defining the new design for the subtree library and starting with it.

## New subtree library design

The new design has 3 main changes compared to the old library:

* Now only store the tree in the json file, not xml and json, and the actions files.
* New modal for importing a subtree from the library.
* New modal to save a subtree to the library.

### New library division

Now the library will be split into 2.

* Standard or Default library: the library that I will increase during this GSoC
* User library: for the user to store their subtrees

This design tries to simplify the user experience and increase the functionality of the old library.

### Other changes

As we now have an exclusive modal for importing from the library, we do not need anymore to check if the subtree name is in the library. This makes the experience clearer to the user, as they decide if they want to import one or just create an empty subtree.

## Beta design of the Import modal

This is a work in progress work, but the main design follows the next points:

* A text input field for the subtree name. This allows the user to decide the name of the imported subtree.
* 2 columns with a list of all the available subtrees to import.
* When each entry is selected it will show a preview of the subtree to import as well as extra information about it.
