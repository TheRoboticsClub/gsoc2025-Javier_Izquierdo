As the week 5 did not have much actual content apart from bugfixes, I decided to merge it with the sixth one that has all of the features finished in the versio 0.10.0 of BT Studio, as well as the versions 5.6.0 of Robotics Application Manager and Robotics Infrastructure.

## Looking at the improvements in the interface in version 0.10.0
